# Module v/s Package

> Note: A module is a collection of source files and build settings that let you divide your project into discrete units of functionality. Your project can have one or many modules. You can independently build, test, and debug each module.

> A package is basically a directory or a folder that groups related classes, whereas a module provides a container for your app's source code, resource files, and app-level settings. A module can contain multiple packages.
