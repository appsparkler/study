# Accessibility

## Why?
- We have the opportunity to make things accessible
- Think about the visually challenged persona - they are just seeing a blur or complete darkness.  Isn't your offering for this persona as well?
- there are two parts to the equation 
    1. the challenged and 
    1. the one who has to provide for the challenged
- so the question is - is the provider capable or incapable of providing?
- the ability or the disablity is of the provider/environment - since the same person in an accessible environment becomes capable.
> People have impairments, it is the environments/providers inability that make them disabled.
