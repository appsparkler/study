# Practicals - make your site accessible

## `<img />`
Best practices:
- add alt attribute describing the image - screen-readers will read this out to the user
- we can avoid alt attribute if it is redundant - in that case, simply add empty string for alt attribute

## Videos
Best Practice
- Add captions, transciptions
- Sign language interpretation

## General Guidelines
- Try to use indicators other than color - for ex. shapes, text, labels, patterns, etc.


## Tips
- Avoid flashing or blinking content - WCAG mandate

### Colors
- Print a color in B/W and see if it is understandable to us - this is how we could step in the shoes of someone who is color blind.
- Use high contrast ratio colors - for ex. blact text on white background or vice-versa - 5:1 contrast ratio is recommended by WCAG

### Audios And Videos
- Avoid auto-play on videos

## Keyboard Goals
- Getting through navigational links and sections
- Getting into and out of search and form fields easily
- Navigating through forms
