# Accessibility

## Getting Started
- semantic HTML
    - we need to use `button` for click interaction
    - we need to use `h1, h2, h3, h4, etc.` in the correct order
    - we need to use native form-controls for dropdowns, radios, checkbox instead of div, span, etc.
    - if we need to, due to unavoidable reason, use un-semantic element, ensure the following:
        - add `tabindex`
        - add `role` - for ex. `role="button"` for a button.  There are many other roles available to define the role of an element
- designing color accessible webpages
