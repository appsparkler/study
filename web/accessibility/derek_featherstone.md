# Accessibility for web design

## Accessible Web Design
- Think about the varios personas while building your site.  How would they navigate or complete tasks on the site?  For ex. on an ecomm site, it would be helpful to a keyboard user to be able to tab to the order-summary before entering the billing information even though the billing information comes first in the layout.

## Accessible Design
- Color should not be the only method to communicate our message or the indicator - use shapes, patterns, labels, text, etc. along with color to improve accessiblility
- maintain contrast ratios - 4.5:1 is ideal, 5:1 is great, less than 3:1 is difficult for people
- Animations and motions 
    - try to avoid it
    - if we use it, have extremely smooth transitions and avoid jerky animations
    - provide option to user to turn on/off
    - respect the iOS setting and fine-tune the animation
- Ensure that the focus states are clear for all users
- Avoid keyboard traps by list out the tab order in the design.  For ex.
    1. User ID (label)
    1. Password (label)
    1. show/hide password (label)
    1. secret key (label)

## Think in terms of personas
- Its a good practice to build the application having in mind a few personas. It will put us in their shoes and develop an application that is accessible for everyone.  These personas have low vision, blind, deaf, arthritis and autism (ADD).
- Ask yourself
    - Can a person with color blindness access my site?
    - Can a blind person access my site?
    - Can a person with low vision access my site? (maginfies site to 400% or more)
    - can a person complete all tasks on the app with keyboard instead of mouse?
        - for someone who is blind, they cannot see where the cursor is on the screen.  They use screen reader.
    - can a person who can see the screen, locate where the mouse is from a distance?
    - how can you offer the same functionality to people who can't touch the screen?
