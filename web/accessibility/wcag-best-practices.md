Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

## The 4 princiles (P.O.U.R)
- P - Perceivable - ensuring that we provide appropriate content for all users regardless of disabilities or accessibilities challenge they might face
- O - Operable - do everything on keybord you can do with a mouse
- U - Understandable - ensure that our content is digestible by everyone 
- R - Robust - ensure our site works with all agents (devices/software, etc.) and assisted technology

## Best Practices 
- Show "billing address is same as shipping address"
- Help pages to have the following information:
    - Phone number & hours
    - Contact form
    - Email address
    - Chatbot
    - Human messaging
    - Frequently Asked Questions
    - Support / help pages
    - Social media channels
- focus indicator needs to be visible clearly on B/W mode of our website.
- focus should not be hidden behind other elements - for ex. by the chat box
- avoid drag and 
- Target Size for CTAs
    - minimum of 44X44 px is good to have  (with some exceptions)
    - 24px X 24px is allowed - 
    - If it is less than that, there needs to be enough empty space around them so that the total is 24px - for. ex if a button is 12px square, there needs to be empty space of 12px around it.
- Focused Elements
    - solid outline
    - focused v/s unfocused contrast > 3:1
    - adjacent contrast > 3:1
