### 1 - Broken Access Control
- ensureing people have access to what they're supposed to and don't have access to what they are not.

### 2 - Cryptographic Failures
> The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in transit and at rest. For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets require extra protection.
- the two parts to avoid failures
    1. define data that needs to be protected
    1. follow well known measures to encrypt
- outsource the responsibility of storing sensitive data to credible 3rd parties
