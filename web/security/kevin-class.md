## Security
- Threat Model - think of web security in terms of how a king and queen would protect their castle.  Depending on the current state of affairs, they need to draw up a threat model:
    - profile of an attacker
    - likely attack vectors
    - high value assets
    - vulnerabilities

## Profile of an attacker
- hackers can be of two kinds - 
    1. white hat - very skilled security tester
    1. black hat - doing harm
- For an attacker on the web, these are a few kind of black hat hackers:
    type | skill | persistence | goals | about
    -|-|-|-|-
    curious users | no | nope | abc | curious about the internet, etc.
    script kiddies | low | random | feels like pro | uses scripts from the internet and tries to attack
    hacktivists | mixed | very high | their cause, embarass | they try to attack a site that they are activating against
    criminals | mixed | high | thefts, scams | as the name suggest
    tropy hunters | high | medium | bragging rights | for name and fame
    governments | very high | very high | intel, espionage, etc.
