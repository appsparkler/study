## Welcome DevSecOps
- Need to 
    1. Automation 
        - this is the key.  All tools need to be upgraded as everything needs to happen quickly.  Only meaningful results needs to be pushed for developers to consume on the fly.
        - flip the role of security team to auditor
        - real time notification for developers
        - ChapOps, not PDFs - JIRA, Teams, etc.
    1. Education - educate/train developers
    1. Empowerment
        - ensure developers have the tools and resources to fix security issues
        - empower the developer to own the security
- **shifting security to the left** - bring it closer to the development team - the security team needs to provide developers 
    1. the framework
    1. the tools
    1. the expertise
- **dev team and security team are partners.  Dev team is responsible, security team is accountable.**
