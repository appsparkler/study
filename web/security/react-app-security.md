## Resources and Tools
- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/ - OWASP Cheat Sheet
- XSS demo - https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/learning/xss/

## Overview of security threats
- Cheat-sheet section of OWASP is an excellent resource for finding out how to secure our app
- React inherently has a security mechanism to protect from XSS - it provides the attribute `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` instead of the normal `innerHTML` propery.
