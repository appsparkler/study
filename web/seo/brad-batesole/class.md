# Advanced SEO


## Creating your information architecture
- Indexable content
    - Check your website in how a crawler may see your page - tools like
        - Google Search Console has a `Crawl > Fetch as Google` option 
        - https://webcache.googleusercontent.com 
        - Chrome in headless mode - https://chrome-devtools-frontend.appspot.com
        - Screaming Frog SEO Spider
        - compare the rendered page to the crawled page
- improving site indexability
    - provide descriptive `alt` text for all images
    - suppliment any non-text content with text
    - provide transcript for video and audio content - tools like speach-pad may be helpful
    - ensure CSS or JS files are not blocked from being crawled
    - restrict PDF or convert them to HTML as appropriate
    - Exercise:
        - crawl your site with a tool like Screaming Frog SEO Spider and check how many pages were crawled
        - check your site by doing a search on Google like so: `site:appsparkler.com`
        - now match the number of pages on both results - if they are more or less same, your site is being crawled correctly.
