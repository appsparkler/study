## Keyword Research Plan
- Put yourself in the shoes of your customers - if you were a client for your own website/idea, what would you search for on Google to get to your website?
- Google Trends and https://answerthepublic.com are two websites that will help us the value of our keywords.
- Long Tail Keywords - descriptive keywords used in less common variations.  For ex. case is extremely competetive, "iphone cases" too is very competetive, "protective blue iPhone cases" - this is a long tail (more descriptive keyword) and is less competetive.
