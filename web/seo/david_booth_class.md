## Keyword Research Plan
- Put yourself in the shoes of your customers - if you were a client for your own website/idea, what would you search for on Google to get to your website?
- Google Trends and https://answerthepublic.com are two websites that will help us the value of our keywords.
- Long Tail Keywords - descriptive keywords used in less common variations.  For ex. case is extremely competetive, "iphone cases" too is very competetive, "protective blue iPhone cases" - this is a long tail (more descriptive keyword) and is less competetive.
- https://moz.com also has a great tool for keyword research
- **Relevance** - ensure the keyword is relevant
- **Search Volume** - ensure the keyword has a significant volume (unless you're targeting a very specific group). There are various tools for this:
    - Moz Keyword Explorer
    - WordStream
    - Ahrefs Keyword Explorer
    - SEMRush Keyword Magic Tool
    - Google Trends
    - Google Keyword Plan (on your Google Ads account)
- **Keyword Competetion** - aka "Keyword difficulty" - expensive keywords due to many bidders.
- **Ongoing Keyword Evaluation** - keep reviewing our keywords to check if they are scoring well on ROI or not.  Use paid search from Google or Bing to see the performance of our keywords.

## Keyword Distribution
Every page in a website has different content.  Thus it is important to perform a keyword distribution - i.e. align page content with target keywords
- organise mapping to keywords
- track keywords that still need pages
- use a spreadsheet tool to organize the data
- the columns would be something like this:
    - URL of the page
    - `<title>` tag
    - number of characters in title (65 is the general target)
    - `<meta-description>` tag
    - number of characters in meta-description (156 is the general target)
    - `<h1>` header

## Content
- **Quality Content** - content needs to be clear and of good quality - both people and search engines look for this.  Just like, we would bin a page that doesn't give us information we need, search engines don't index pages that are not of good quality.
- **Clean Site Structure** - always have a clean and clear site structure which will help SEs easily understand it.
    - URL should contain usable information about the page itself - for ex. https://letsrecite.app/the-essence-of-the-bhagavad-gita/chapter-02-verse-47
    - use `-` instead of spaces or underscores
    - Page title needs to be clear - for ex. `<title>Chapter 2, Verse 47 - Lets Recite App<title>`
    - Add a `meta-description` tag - `<meta name="description" content="Easily recite The Essence Of The Bhagavad Gita - " />`
    - Add a single descriptive `h1` tag - `<h1>Lets Recite The Essence of The Bhagavad Gita</h1>`
    - Keep tweaking the `title and meta description, h1 etc.` to see difference in performance 
    - Content needs to be optimized for people first and SEs later because SEs also are trying to emulate human behavior so if you're able to attract humans, SE will follow the trail
- **Optimizing non-text components of webpage** - 
    - add `alt` attribute to images, properly describing the image.
    - also, the image file name can be descriptive - for ex `<img src="../images/backpacking-tours-in-california-">`.
    - we can also use image-captions
    - for links, we can use a `title` attribute
    - Structured Data - use Google's Structured Data
    - Also, look at https://schema.org/imageObject to
