## Keyword Research Plan
- Put yourself in the shoes of your customers - if you were a client for your own website/idea, what would you search for on Google to get to your website?
- Google Trends and https://answerthepublic.com are two websites that will help us the value of our keywords.
- Long Tail Keywords - descriptive keywords used in less common variations.  For ex. case is extremely competetive, "iphone cases" too is very competetive, "protective blue iPhone cases" - this is a long tail (more descriptive keyword) and is less competetive.
- https://moz.com also has a great tool for keyword research
- **Relevance** - ensure the keyword is relevant
- **Search Volume** - ensure the keyword has a significant volume (unless you're targeting a very specific group). There are various tools for this:
    - Moz Keyword Explorer
    - WordStream
    - Ahrefs Keyword Explorer
    - SEMRush Keyword Magic Tool
    - Google Trends
    - Google Keyword Plan (on your Google Ads account)
- **Keyword Competetion** - aka "Keyword difficulty" - expensive keywords due to many bidders,

## Keyword Distribution
Every page in a website has different content.  Thus it is important to perform a keyword distribution - i.e. align page content with target keywords
- organise mapping to keywords
- track keywords that still need pages
- use a spreadsheet tool to organize the data
- the columns would be something like this:
    - URL of the page
    - `<title>` tag
    - number of characters in title (65 is the general target)
    - `<meta-description>` tag
    - number of characters in meta-description (156 is the general target)
    - `<h1>` header
