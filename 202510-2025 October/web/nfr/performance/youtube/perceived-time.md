# Perceived Time
- reference URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oWpsNSOqOw
- We perceive time in active phase or passive phase.  
- Active phase is when we are engaged, doing something - browsing through a catalogue, learning something interesting, etc.
- Passive phase is when we are waiting for something - for ex. waiting for a page to load, waiting in a queue, riding in the elevator, etc.
- Passive phase, by default seems longer - 36% longer.
- 2 strategies for better UX:
    1. Keep users in active stage as much as possible
    1. Make passive stage seem smaller/faster.
        - don't tell users they are waiting - don't show loaders until loading time approaches ~1 seconds.
        - responding to users immediately, even if nothing is happening - add `:active` states to all our elements.
        - keeps users in flow with more responsive event listeners
