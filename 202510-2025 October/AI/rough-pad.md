I am a Senior React Developer.
I have just converted a React Javascript project to a Vite Typescript project.
I am attaching a ZIP file of the project.
Review the project based on this criteria.
- Atleast 70% of the files in the src folder have a .ts or .tsx extension
- Atleast 8 files in the src folder have .test.tsx or .test.ts extension
- Atleast 20% files in the ./src/components folder has .stories.tsx or .stories.ts extension.
