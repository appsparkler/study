# Lodash

- try to use sugar wherever possible
- `reject` and `filter` are methods to refine a list
- `groupBy` is a great way to group data
- `orderBy` is a great way to sort data.  It accepts one required argument and another optional argument.  Both are arrays.  The first argument is an array of properties we want to order by and second argument is an array of the how we want to sort `asc` or `desc`.
