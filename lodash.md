# Lodash

- try to use sugar wherever possible
- `reject` and `filter` are methods to refine a list
- `groupBy` is a great way to group data
- `orderBy` is a great way to sort data.  It accepts one required argument and another optional argument.  Both are arrays.  The first argument is an array of properties we want to order by and second argument is an array of the how we want to sort `asc` or `desc`.
- getting parts of the array - `head` returns to first member of an array, `tail` returns all elements except head. `last` returns the last member of an array, `initial` will return all members except the last one.

# String utils
- `toLower` and `toUpper` are to change the case.  The unique thing about these methods is that they can be used with `chain`
- `split` and `join` methods are to split/join a string/array with a delimitter.
- `camelCase` and `snakeCase` are to convert strings to camel or snake case
