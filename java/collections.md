# Collections

## Factors for selecting a collection type
- is the order important
- are duplicates allowed
- speed of operations
- memory use

## Notes
- All types of collections implement `Iterable` - it is at the top of the hierarchy.
- `Collection` is not a concrete class (i.e. a class that can be used).  
- `Set, List, Queue` too are not concrete classes - they are interfaces and have specific behaviours.
