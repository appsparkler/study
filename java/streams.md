# Streams
Data Streams, like real water streams, can flow only in one direction at a time.
There are two primary streams in Java - input and output - input streams read 
in data.  Output streams write out data.

## Examples of `InputStream`
- FileInputStream
- ByteArrayInputStream
- FilterInputStream
- etc...

## Examples of `OutputStream`
- FileOutputStream
- ByteArrayOutputStream
- FilterOutputStream
- etc...

## Scanner
Scanner can be used to read input - from terminal, etc.

## BufferedReader
Can be used to read a file in the system.
