# Classes

# `static` function
When a function doesn't use the attributes of a class but still relates to the overall theme or idea of the class.

# `static` v/s `non-static` variables
Static variables hold data that don't change over the lifecycle of a class whereas non-static (aka dynamic) variables can change over
the lifecycle of the class.
