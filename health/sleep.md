# Optimizing Sleep
https://marcelclasses.udemy.com/course/sleep-course/learn/lecture/38272112

## Analyze your sleep
- 7 hours is recommended
- Find your own optimal sleep duration by observing yourself:
    - do you feel refreshed when you wake up?  If not, you need to sleep more.
    - feel fatigue during the day? If yes, sleep more.
    - too many mood disturbances? if yes, you need to sleep more
    - good focus and alertness? if yes, you are sleeping well
- quality is just as important to quantity.

## Circadian Rythm 
- light plays a crucial role in regulating our body's circadian rythm which is responsible for controlling our sleep-wake cycle and sleep quality.
- The Rythm - just like the sun rises and sets every day, our bodies too have a cycle, a rythm that follows a 24 hour cycle.
- if we follow this cycle regularly, it will promote alertness during the day and help us sleep more easily at night.
- When this circadian rythm, this cycle, this internal clock is disrupted, it will put us out of balance.
- so, we need to consistently follow this cycle and pay attention to our body's signals and act on them.

## Science Based Tool
1. Morning & Afternoon Sulight Viewing - 30 - 60 minutes after waking up, view the sun for 5/10/20-30 mins on sunny/cloudy/overcast,rainy days.
1. Its important to get outside of your house - on the terrace, on the playground, anywhere but outside of windows and walls.
1. Cortisol
    - There's a group of neurons in our nervous system that respond best to bright light.  Once activated, they send chemical and electrical signals that trigger increase in the hormone cortisol.
    - though cortisol has a bad rep for cause of stress, it is actually beneficial for cortisol to reach its peak in the early mornings - it keeps us active during the rest of the day.  With more work accomplished in the active state, we are able to sleep easily after sunset.
    - this makes our internal clock more robost, promoting active-ness during the day and deep sleep at night.
1. Avoid bright light after sunset
    - dim the lights
    - moonlight and candle lights are a good option.
