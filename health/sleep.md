# The Science
- 7 hours is recommended
- Find your own optimal sleep duration by observing yourself:
    - do you feel refreshed when you wake up?  If not, you need to sleep more.
    - feel fatigue during the day? If yes, sleep more.
    - too many mood disturbances? if yes, you need to sleep more
    - good focus and alertness? if yes, you are sleeping well
