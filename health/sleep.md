## Analyze your sleep
- 7 hours is recommended
- Find your own optimal sleep duration by observing yourself:
    - do you feel refreshed when you wake up?  If not, you need to sleep more.
    - feel fatigue during the day? If yes, sleep more.
    - too many mood disturbances? if yes, you need to sleep more
    - good focus and alertness? if yes, you are sleeping well
- quality is just as important to quantity.

## Circadian Rythm 
- light plays a crucial role in regulating our body's circadian rythm which is responsible for controlling our sleep-wake cycle and sleep quality.
- The Rythm - just like the sun rises and sets every day, our bodies too have a cycle, a rythm that follows a 24 hour cycle.
- if we follow this cycle regularly, it will promote alertness during the day and help us sleep more easily at night.
- When this circadian rythm, this cycle, this internal clock is disrupted, it will put us out of balance.
- so, we need to consistently follow this cycle and pay attention to our body's signals and act on them.
