# Optimizing Sleep
https://marcelclasses.udemy.com/course/sleep-course/learn/lecture/38272112

## Analyze your sleep
- 7 hours is recommended
- Find your own optimal sleep duration by observing yourself:
    - do you feel refreshed when you wake up?  If not, you need to sleep more.
    - feel fatigue during the day? If yes, sleep more.
    - too many mood disturbances? if yes, you need to sleep more
    - good focus and alertness? if yes, you are sleeping well
- quality is just as important to quantity.

## Circadian Rythm 
- light plays a crucial role in regulating our body's circadian rythm which is responsible for controlling our sleep-wake cycle and sleep quality.
- The Rythm - just like the sun rises and sets every day, our bodies too have a cycle, a rythm that follows a 24 hour cycle.
- if we follow this cycle regularly, it will promote alertness during the day and help us sleep more easily at night.
- When this circadian rythm, this cycle, this internal clock is disrupted, it will put us out of balance.
- so, we need to consistently follow this cycle and pay attention to our body's signals and act on them.

## Science Based Tool - Luminosity
1. Morning & Afternoon Sulight Viewing - 30 - 60 minutes after waking up, view the sun for 5/10/20-30 mins on sunny/cloudy/overcast,rainy days.
1. Its important to get outside of your house - on the terrace, on the playground, anywhere but outside of windows and walls.
1. Cortisol
    - There's a group of neurons in our nervous system that respond best to bright light.  Once activated, they send chemical and electrical signals that trigger increase in the hormone cortisol.
    - though cortisol has a bad rep for cause of stress, it is actually beneficial for cortisol to reach its peak in the early mornings - it keeps us active during the rest of the day.  With more work accomplished in the active state, we are able to sleep easily after sunset.
    - this makes our internal clock more robost, promoting active-ness during the day and deep sleep at night.
1. Avoid bright light after sunset
    - dim the lights
    - moonlight and candle lights are a good option.
    - 

## Science Based Tool - Temperatue
1. Every morning cold water exposure for 3 minutes - shower, cold plunges, etc.
    - this elevates hormones like Adrenaline and Epinephrine.  It stimulates our body's thermostat system which helps regulate our bodys internal clock.  This leads to secretion of Cortisol and an elevation in body temperature.
    - it also boosts the production of dopamine - a molecule that plays a role in motivation and focus.  It will enhance both physical and mental clarity and concentration.
    - if done regularly, it may also help us stay lean 
1. Every evening - exposure to warmth for upto 20 minutes - 80 - 100 degree Celcius
    - improves cardiac health, detoxification
