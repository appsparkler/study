# Data Integrations
 There are many ways to integrate data from other sources, include new data or modify existing data into GA.
For ex:
1. Add new events or change existing ones - this can be done from the admin panel > events
1. Measurement Protocol - a standard set of rules for collecting and sending events to Google Analytics
1. Data Imports - upload data from external sources and join it with our analytics data.


## Measurement Protocol (MP)
- It is a standard set of rules for collecting and sending events directly to Google Analytics servers.  
- It lets us send data to Analytics from internet-connected devices like a kiosk or point-of-sale system that complement your website or app.  As imagined, with MP, we have to manually program events.
- Measurement Protocol data and events are joined with existing Analytics data via a join key, such as user_id or event_id.

## Data Import
- it lets you upload your external data and combine it with or override existing Google Analytics data.
