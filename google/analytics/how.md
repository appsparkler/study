# How to integrate GA in our app/web-site?

To collect data from our app/website, we need to add a small piece of code to our website/app.
This "small piece of code" is also called a "tag" in the Google Analytics world.


Tags can be added directly to our website or by using a tag management system like GTM (Google Tag Manager)


It is this tag that will connect the information about users like device type, location, interaction, etc.
