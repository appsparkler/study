# Figma


First we need to create the frame which will hold the UI we are designing.  
A frame is usually a rectangle of the size of a screen we are developing for - mobile, tablet or desktop.

- press <kbd>F</kbd> to select the frame mode.
- select the device we are designing for - for ex. Iphone Max Pro 14
- press <kbd>R</kbd> to select rectangle mode and draw the rectangles we need for our design
