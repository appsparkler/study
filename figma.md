# Figma


First we need to create the frame which will hold the UI we are designing.  
A frame is usually a rectangle of the size of a screen we are developing for - mobile, tablet or desktop.

- press <kbd>F</kbd> to select the frame mode.
- select the device we are designing for - for ex. Iphone Max Pro 14
- press <kbd>R</kbd> to select rectangle mode and draw the rectangles we need for our design
- press <kbd>E</kbd> to select elliptical mode draw the ellipses and circles for our design.
- double click mouse twice to select an element inside another element
- hold `option` to see the distance of an element from its constraints.
- move an element in any direction with the arrow keys (hold `option` simultaneously to keep a track of the distance from its constraints)
- select icons by searching `free Figma icons` or a resource like this one : figma.com/resources/assets/evericons-for-figma/
- <kbd>CMD + \</kbd> to hide/show UI controls
- feel free to copy/paste elements from one Figma to another
- easily copy/paste images to a Figma file
