# Test Setup

- Create a new directory under `app`
- Create a package in the directory - name it `<app-domain>.test` - for ex. `com.example.cupcake.test`
- Create a class file in the package for the test - for ex. `CupcackeNavigationTest`

## Naming Convention

### File Name

We can call our files which have the test as `<what_we_are_testing>Test` - for ex. `CupcackeScreenNavigationTest`

## Test Name

> Note: Test method names are different from the function names you use in app code. A good naming convention for test methods is the following: `thingUnderTest_TriggerOfTest_ResultOfTest`. Using the function you just created as an example, it is clear that you are testing the cupcake nav host by clicking the One Cupcake button, and the expected result is navigation to the Flavor screen.
